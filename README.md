# Password Generator

A password generator in JavaScript

[password-generator.pruvostbastien.fr](https://password-generator.pruvostbastien.fr)


## About the project

Another practice project where I created a random password generator.

We select the number of characters and the types of characters that we want in the password, then we click on "generate" and the password is displayed.

There is a feature to copy the password to the clipboard.


## Features

- Select number of characters
- Select type of characters (Uppercase, Number, Special characters)
- Random password generation
- Copy generated password to clipboard
